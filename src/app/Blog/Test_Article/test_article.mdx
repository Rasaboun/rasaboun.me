# Server-Side Rendering in Next.js

## Introduction

Next.js is a JavaScript framework used for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It is gaining popularity due to its ease of use and ability to handle both client-side and server-side rendering. In this blog post, we will discuss the basics of server-side rendering in Next.js.

## What is Server-Side Rendering?

Server-Side Rendering is the process of rendering web pages on the server before sending them to the client. This means that when a user requests a page, the server generates the HTML for the page, and sends it to the client as a complete HTML document. This approach has several advantages, including better performance, SEO, and accessibility.

## How Next.js Implements SSR

Next.js provides a simple and easy-to-use API for implementing SSR. It uses Node.js and React to generate HTML on the server-side. When a user requests a page, Next.js first generates the HTML on the server, and then sends it to the client. After that, it loads the JavaScript and rehydrates the page on the client-side. This approach allows Next.js to provide a seamless experience for the user, while also providing the benefits of SSR.

## Benefits of Server-Side Rendering in Next.js

There are several benefits of using SSR in Next.js. First, it improves the performance of the application by reducing the amount of JavaScript required to render the page. This can result in faster load times and a better user experience. Second, it improves SEO by providing search engines with a fully rendered HTML page. Finally, it improves accessibility by providing a fully rendered HTML page to users who may have difficulty accessing JavaScript-based applications.

## Conclusion

Server-Side Rendering in Next.js is a powerful tool for improving the performance, SEO, and accessibility of your React applications. Next.js provides a simple and easy-to-use API for implementing SSR, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to improve the user experience of their applications. If you are looking to build a server-side rendered React application, Next.js is definitely worth considering.

## Implementing Server-Side Rendering in Next.js

Implementing Server-Side Rendering in Next.js is a straightforward process. Here are the basic steps to follow:

1. Set up a Next.js project: First, create a new Next.js project by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app

```

1. Create a new page: Next, create a new page by creating a new file in the `pages` directory. For example, create a file called `about.js` in the `pages` directory.

```js
function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is the about page</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default About

```

1. Add server-side rendering: To add server-side rendering to the `about` page, add the `getServerSideProps` function to the page's file. This function will be called on the server-side and will return the data needed to render the page.

```js
function About({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>{data}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('<https://api.example.com/data>')
  const data = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  }
}

export default About

```

1. Test the page: Finally, run the development server to test the page.

```bash
npm run dev

```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about) to see the server-side rendered about page.

## Conclusion

Server-Side Rendering in Next.js is a powerful tool for building fast, SEO-friendly, and accessible React applications. Next.js makes it easy to implement server-side rendering with its simple and intuitive API. By using server-side rendering, you can improve the performance of your application, enhance its SEO, and provide a better user experience for all users.
