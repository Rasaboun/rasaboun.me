# The Benefits of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for Web Development

### Nowadays, websites need to be fast and optimised for SEO in order to provide the best user experience and improve search engine rankings.

### Today, we will be discussing one solution for achieving a fast and SEO optimised website: Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

### But before we dive into that, let's first understand how React displays our  web page.

## Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

Client-Side Rendering is a rendering method that involves sending HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the user's browser.

Once everything is loaded, the JavaScript takes over and generate the page, the page is render and Javascript make it interactive.

The downside of this method is that the HTML file is initially blank, and the JavaScript then fills it with content, which can lead to SEO problems.

Google's web crawler can execute JavaScript, which allows your website to be properly indexed, but it may take longer as the crawler needs to render your site first.

Additionally, social media platforms require meta tags to generate a preview of your site.

## Advantages

- **Faster initial load time**, since the server only sends a blank HTML file and the browser handles the rendering.
- **Lower server load**, since the server only needs to send static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Image) to the client.

## Disadvantages

- **Slower time to be interactive**, since the browser must first load all the static assets and then execute the JavaScript code to render the page.
- **SEO issues**, search engines may not be able to read the JavaScript generated content.
- **Load Time** can be longer on slower devices or networks, since client-side rendering requires more processing power and memory.
- **Limit the number of users** since some users may have JavaScript disabled.

## Now we can talk about Server-Side Rendering

With server-side rendering, when a user requests a page, the server generates the HTML page and sends it to the browser, which then renders the page with CSS and JavaScript.

Perfect, you might say? Well, not quite!

Currently, our site is not interactive; for example, buttons don't work because the hydration step is missing.

*What is hydration?*

Hydration enables the transition between the page generated by the server and our browser.

It will link the "**event handlers**" to our page.

In short, this will link, for example, an HTML button to a JavaScript function that will perform an action, such as sending the message you wrote in a chat.

## Advantages

- **Improved performance**, since the server generates the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web page.
- **Better SEO**, since search engines can easily crawl and index server-rendered pages.
- **Faster time-to-interactive**, especially on slower devices or networks, since the initial rendering is done on the server-side.
- **Improved user experience**, since the web page becomes interactive sooner.

## Disadvantages

- **Increased complexity**, since server-side rendering requires additional configuration and setup.
- **Higher server load**, since the server must generate the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for each request.
- **Limited support for certain client-side functionality**, that rely on the browser's Document Object Model (DOM).
- **Longer initial load time**, since the server must generate the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for each request.
- **Potential for mismatched content between server and client**, since the server and client must both render the same content. (Hydration)

## Conclusion

Now you know the basics of Client-Side Rendering and Server-Side Rendering!

Oh, wait, I forgot to tell you about possible hydration errors because React expects the server-side and client-side rendering to be exactly the same.

Don't worry; I'll talk about it in my next post with a concrete example I had on one of my projects.

See you Soon !!
